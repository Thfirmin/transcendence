# Routmap

this routmap dictates the function and use of each component in this repository.

It is designed to prevent:

- Misallocated resources
	> with increased content, misallocated resources increases the risk of
	> generating content that is difficult to find and consume,
	> and is consequently difficult to maintain and update.
- duplicate resources
	> duplicate resources in different places,
	> increasing maintenance rework on updates,
	> as well as contributing to misuse and user experience.
- Poorly written resources
	> Poorly written resources, by being in the wrong
	> place or using the wrong styles.


    For inclusion's sake, this routmap'll be always written with most known language (actually's english [en-usa]).

## Layout

> !This section is subject to change seeing that each project can follow a different layout.

Points to follow in any implemented layout:

- The project will be stored in repository and documentations'll be storaged in documentation pages.
- Repositories will have a simple macro documentation of essential parts of use project.
- If you have a single language to inform anything, use the most known language for inclusion's sake
- Repository documentation will be follow this pattern:
	- Main `README` file, (located in repository root) will introduce the project
	- Main `README` file'll connect the international READMEs
	- Sub-READMEs file will be renamed using `README.<lang>.md` pattern (Ex:. README.pt.md)
	- Sub-READMEs file will document the main body of repository documentation.
